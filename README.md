# Monte Carlo Methods

This repository is meant to hold exploratory Python scripts for investigating Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Some notes on Monte Carlo methods are included.

## Summary
Monte Carlo methods are a class of statistical methods that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.

Types of MC methods we will look at:
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Monte Carlo integration

## Status
- [ ] Monte Carlo integration
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation
