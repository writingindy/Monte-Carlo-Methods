    "## Monte Carlo Integration\n",

    "There are many integration techniques that can be used to compute integrals. But the vast majority of integrals do not have analytic answers! So we must resort to numerical methods of computing integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the numerical computation of integrals, there are several options:\n",
    "- quadrature (eg: midpoint, trapezoidal, Simpson's rule)\n",
    "- adaptive methods\n",
    "- Newton-Cotes formulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these options suffer from the curse of dimensionality. As the number of dimensions of the integral increases, you need in general, an exponential amount of function evaluations to compute the integral numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we consider Monte Carlo integration, which approximates the following integral as\n",
    "$$\\int_{[0, 1]^d} f(x)dx \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} f(x_i)$$\n",
    "where the domain of consideration is a d-dimensional hypercube $[0, 1]^d$, $x_1, x_2,..., x_N \\sim U([0, 1]^d)$ are points uniformly sampled from the d-dimensional hypercube, and $N$ is the number of points that we sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Monte Carlo integration has a convergence rate that is independent of the number of dimensions of the integral.\n"
